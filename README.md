**Proposed Level of Achievement:** Apollo


### Motivation

Our motivation to develop a game app centered on the life of polar bears stems from a deep-rooted fascination with these majestic creatures, inspired by numerous documentaries and literary works that delve into the transformative experiences of humans morphing into animals. This unique perspective has ignited a passion in us to create an immersive environment where gamers can step into the paws of polar bears, experiencing their daily struggles and joys firsthand.

Through this game, we aim to bridge the gap between human understanding and animal life, fostering a deeper empathy and respect for polar bears and their natural habitat. The challenges faced by these magnificent creatures, such as hunting for food, braving the harsh Arctic environment, and navigating the treacherous waters, will be meticulously recreated to provide an authentic and educational experience.

Moreover, this project is an opportunity to raise awareness about the impact of climate change on polar bear populations and their shrinking ice habitats. By simulating the life of polar bears, we hope to inspire players to take actionable steps toward environmental conservation and to appreciate the intricate balance of our ecosystem. This game is not just a source of entertainment but a call to action, a blend of education, empathy, and engagement with the natural world.

### Vision

Polar Bear Simulator will be a single-player PC RPG game set in the frozen continent of Antarctica, with a 3D 32-bit low poly art style. Polar Bear Simulator’s gameplay will be inspired by classics like Travel Frogs and QQ Farm, played from a top-down camera view. Specific game features are elaborated in the following sections.

We aim to provide an immersive experience of a polar bear’s daily life, showcasing their habits and the challenges they face. By navigating these challenges, players will uncover the root cause—environmental damage caused by human behavior. Through this journey, we hope to raise awareness and encourage efforts to protect the environment.

## Realistic Hunting Mechanics

The game simulates the hunting behavior of polar bears in great detail, allowing players to stalk and ambush seals, fish, and other Arctic wildlife. Techniques like camouflaging in the snow, using wind direction to avoid alerting prey, and initiating swift attacks are crucial gameplay elements. The game also incorporates a stamina system that depletes during chases, adding a layer of challenge and realism.


## Swimming and Diving

Players can explore extensive underwater environments reflective of the Arctic ocean. The swimming mechanics are designed to mimic the powerful, yet graceful movements of a polar bear. Aspects such as managing breath while diving, navigating through icy waters, and hunting underwater prey are integrated to enhance the immersive experience. The game might also feature challenges like strong currents and ice blockades.


## Hibernation Cycle

This feature focuses on the preparation for and the process of hibernation. Players must effectively manage their food intake and fat reserves before winter arrives. The game simulates the gradual decrease in bear activity and the need for a secure and insulated den. During hibernation, the game could present mini-challenges or decision-making scenarios that affect the bear's condition upon awakening.


## Survival Elements

In addition to hunting and hibernation, players must navigate various survival challenges like avoiding predators such as wolves, facing human encroachments, and dealing with environmental hazards (e.g., melting ice caps and oil spills). The game could include a dynamic weather system where sudden snowstorms or blizzards require finding shelter or facing dire consequences.

## Environmental Interaction

The game’s environment is interactive and changes with the seasons. Players can manipulate objects in the world, such as breaking ice to create hunting paths or using the terrain to hide from threats. Seasonal changes affect gameplay, with varying day lengths and temperatures influencing the game's strategy and pacing.


### Educational Content

As players engage with the game, they encounter various educational tidbits about polar bears and their habitat. These can include pop-up facts during gameplay, interactive documentaries accessible from the game menu, and missions centered around conservation efforts. This feature aims to raise awareness about the real-world challenges polar bears face due to climate change and human activities.

Our goal for "Polar Bear Simulator" is to deliver an authentic and immersive simulation of the life of a polar bear in the Arctic. We aim to combine engaging gameplay with educational content to captivate and inform players. As we refine the game, our objective is to launch on platforms like Steam, targeting 100 initial downloads without relying on a large advertising budget. Through this game, we hope to foster appreciation and awareness for polar bears and their environmental challenges.



### Storyline

## Setting

The game is set in a vast and unforgiving Arctic landscape known as Glacial Bay, a region teeming with wildlife and harsh natural challenges. Central to Glacial Bay is the mystical Aurora Peak, a towering glacier rumored to be the source of ancient polar bear wisdom. The region is split into various zones, each home to distinct ecosystems and challenges, reflecting the polar bear's struggle against climate change and shrinking habitats.


## Plot

The protagonist of "Polar Bear Simulator" is Taotao, a young polar bear who has been separated from his family after an unprecedented ice melt. Taotao is intuitive, resilient, and fiercely independent, yet haunted by fragmented memories of his family and the rich heritage of his species. His journey is about survival, discovery, and the quest to reunite with his family.


#### Arc 1: Survival and Learning

The game begins with Taotao learning the basic survival skills of a polar bear—hunting, swimming, and navigating the treacherous ice. Players will learn how to track different prey, fish in open waters, and protect themselves from predators and harsh weather.

#### Arc 2: The Disappearing Ice (3 Challenges)

As Taotao adapts to life on his own, he faces challenges mirroring the real-world impact of climate change on polar bears. To survive, Taotao must navigate shrinking ice paths, find new hunting grounds as old ones become inaccessible, and compete with other wildlife for dwindling resources. Yet, Taotao constantly wonders why his home is collapsing, as if some mysterious force is at play. Determined, he seeks to uncover the secret and bring peace to the continent.

#### Arc 3: Echoes of the Past

Taotao discovers ancient carvings and signs left by elder bears, leading him to hidden valleys beneath Aurora Peak. Here, he experiences visions from the 'Spirit Realm,' where he sees the majestic life his ancestors led and learns about the ancient wisdom they left behind. These revelations strengthen his resolve to protect his legacy and environment.

#### Arc 4: The Reunion

Armed with knowledge and new skills, Taotao finally traces the scent of his family to a secluded part of Glacial Bay. However, the reunion is threatened by a looming disaster—a massive oil spill. Taotao must rally the local wildlife to prevent the catastrophe and save their home.


#### Arc 5: The Truth

After battling disasters and saving his home, Taotao discovered that all the calamities were caused by environmental damage inflicted by humans. Though he once sought to bring peace to the continent, he realized that his efforts were futile as long as humans continued their harmful ways. Despite the challenges, he remained in this unforgiving land because it is his home.

### Link to Gameplay and Development

Arc 1 serves as an interactive tutorial where players master the core mechanics of hunting, swimming, and survival strategy. Each subsequent challenge or mission incorporates aspects of the environment, such as navigating through cracking ice or stealthily approaching prey, tying gameplay closely to the storyline.

Throughout the game, players encounter various 'Memory Dens,' where Taotao can rest and players can access flashbacks that play out significant events from Taotao's past, providing backstory and depth to his character. These dens also serve as save points.

The combat system involves encounters with natural predators and environmental hazards, requiring players to utilize their skills and the terrain to their advantage. Strategy elements include managing energy and health, particularly during long swims or hunts, reflecting the real-life endurance of polar bears.

At the end of each major arc, a cinematic cutscene ties the accomplishments back to the overarching narrative, emphasizing Taotao's growth and the environmental messages at the heart of the game.
